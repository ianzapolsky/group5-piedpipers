# COMS W4444 - PiedPipers Player - Group 5
# Edward Feng, Moawia Munir Eldeeb, Ian Zapolsky

This directory contains the final code for group 5's player on the piedpipers
challenge for the Programming and Problem Solving class.

## Final Changes from Ian

- Added comments throughout
- Deleted unused functions (handoffMove, among others)
- Deleted unused variables
- Changed the logic of slaveMove to ignore section divisions. I observed slave 
  pipers waiting around due to this check, so instead I allow slave pipers to 
  go after the nearest rat to them over the entire board, which results in 
  better performance for both the sweep and no-sweep cases.
- Reduced distance the piper needs to be from the bottom of the field to signal
  sweepOver. This ensures that no rats will remain beneath the sweep.
