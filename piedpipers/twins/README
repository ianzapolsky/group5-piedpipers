updates:
- all current location removed. the new utilify functions are as following:
 ** modified method **
  int getSide(Point p) 
  boolean haveAllRats()
  boolean closetoWall()
  Point closestRatBelowinHorizontalRange(double left, double right)
  Point closestRatinVerticalRange(double top, double bottom)
  int closestRatinVerticalRangeIndex(double top, double bottom)
  Point closestRat()
  int ratsLeft()
  Point moveTo(Point goal)
 ** newly added index generating method **
  int closestRatIndex()
  int closestRatBelowinHorizontalRangeIndex(double left, double right)
  int closestRatinVerticalRangeIndex(double top, double bottom)
 ** newly added index using method **
  Point chaseRat(int ratIndex)

The chaseRat method would make the greedy algorithm tilt the direction so that unless it's a hard chasing (piper and rats heading in the same direction) it would "catch" the rat instead of chasing it. 

Also, I guess eventually we woule come down to a solution that keeps tracking all the rats using set/map or what not. In that case I think it would be easier to use index instead of actual location since we could always get the location from index but not the other way around.

Cheers
